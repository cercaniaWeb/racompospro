The error indicates that bash attempted to find an executable file at the path \"https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp\" but couldn't locate it.\n\nIf you intended to access the Supabase MCP documentation or API, you would typically do this through a web browser or an HTTP client tool like `curl` or `wget`. For example:\n\n1. To fetch the content using curl:\n   ```bash\n   curl https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp\n   ```\n\n2. To open it in a browser (if you have a GUI environment):\n   ```bash\n   xdg-open https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp\n   ```\n\nIs there a specific action you were trying to perform with this URL? If you're looking for information about Supabase MCP, I can help guide you through relevant documentation or assist with related queries.",
