Since I don't have direct browser access, please focus on checking the codebase for potential visual issues that might occur on the main screens:\n\n1. Review the ModernPOSPage.jsx (the main TPV screen) to identify any elements that shouldn't be there or might cause overflow issues\n2. Check for any components that might be displaying incorrectly after login\n3. Identify any elements that might appear at the bottom of the screen inappropriately\n4. Look for any styling issues that might cause overflow or alignment problems\n5. Review the main 5 screens: Login, POS dashboard, Inventory, Reports, and Settings\n\nThe main focus should be on elements that might appear inappropriately on the TPV screen after login. Since the user mentioned scrolling down on the TPV screen, pay special attention to the bottom of the POS page."
