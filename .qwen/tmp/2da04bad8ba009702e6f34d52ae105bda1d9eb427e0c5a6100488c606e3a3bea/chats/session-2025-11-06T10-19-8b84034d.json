The problem is likely caused by an overlay/backdrop that does not have proper transparency or is using a solid black background in dark mode. You need to:\n\n1. Diagnose the issue by inspecting the Modal Cierre de Caja component\n2. Identify the overlay/backdrop element causing the black screen\n3. Modify the overlay/backdrop styles to use a semi-transparent dark color (like rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)) instead of a solid black\n4. Ensure the modal itself is properly displayed with correct positioning and styling\n\nThe fix should ensure that the modal appears as a floating window with a semi-transparent overlay that doesn't block the view of the application."

Looking at the CSS styles for the modal, I can see that the `.modal-overlay` class has:\n\n```css\n.modal-overlay {\n  position: fixed;\n  inset: 0;\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);  /* This is correct - 50% opacity */\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n  z-index: var(--z-index-modal);\n  padding: var(--spacing-lg);\n}\n```\n\nThe modal overlay CSS looks correct with `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` which should provide a semi-transparent overlay. However, the issue might be related to how the dark mode is affecting the background or there could be an issue with the component itself. Let me check if there are any other CSS files that might be overriding these styles:",
