Since I don't have direct browser access, please focus on checking the codebase for potential visual issues that might occur on the main screens. The main 5 screens of the POS application would typically be:\n\n1. Login screen\n2. POS dashboard/main screen\n3. Inventory management\n4. Reports\n5. Settings/users\n\nFor each screen, review the associated components and identify potential visual issues like:\n- Overflow issues\n- Alignment problems \n- Broken styles (fonts/colors not loading properly)\n- CSS that might not be loading correctly\n- Responsive design issues\n- Dark mode styling inconsistencies\n\nThe login credentials are lromerorez14@gmail.com / Correo123, though you can't actually log in without browser access. Focus on reviewing the code for any potential visual issues that might be present."
