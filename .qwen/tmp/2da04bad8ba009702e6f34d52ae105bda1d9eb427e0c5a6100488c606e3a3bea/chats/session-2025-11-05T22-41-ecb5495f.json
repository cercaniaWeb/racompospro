The `main.tsx` file is rendering the Router component directly without wrapping it in a BrowserRouter. This is what's causing the error \"useRoutes() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component\" because the `<Routes>` component inside Router.jsx needs to be within a Router context (like BrowserRouter), but it's not.\n\nLet me fix this by updating the main.tsx file:",
