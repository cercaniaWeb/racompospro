Here's what I did to resolve the issues:\n\n## Issues Fixed:\n\n1. **Nushell syntax error**: Fixed the `$PATH` to `$env.PATH` syntax in your `/home/lr/.config/nushell/env.nu` file. The correct Nushell syntax requires using `$env.PATH` instead of `$PATH` when referencing environment variables.\n\n2. **Incorrect PATH modification**: Changed the problematic lines that were using `set-env PATH $PATH /path/to/binary` to the proper Nushell method of prepending to PATH using `$env.PATH = ($env.PATH | split row (char esep) | prepend '/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin')`.\n\n3. **Command availability**: Verified that the `qwen` and `gemini` commands are now working properly since they're located in `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin`, which is already in your PATH.\n\n## Summary of Changes:\n\n- Fixed the syntax error in your nushell environment configuration file\n- Updated the PATH to properly include the linuxbrew binaries directory\n- Verified all commands (qwen, gemini, htop) are now working correctly\n\n## About the \"htop++\" Command:\n\nThe `htop++` command doesn't actually exist - there's no such command. The correct command is just `htop`, which you already have installed and working. The error you were seeing was because you were trying to run a non-existent command.\n\nNow your nushell configuration is error-free and all your commands should work as expected!",

Let me show you how to create aliases in Nushell:\n\n## Creating Aliases in Nushell\n\nYou can add aliases in a few ways:\n\n### 1. Temporary alias (only for current session):\n```nu\nalias yazi = ^yazi\n```\n\n### 2. Permanent alias (add to your config):\nAdd this to your `~/.config/nushell/config.nu` file in the aliases section:\n\n```nu\n# In your config.nu file, find or add the $env.config section:\n$env.config = {\n  # ... other config options ...\n  # Add aliases here\n  aliases: {\n    yz: ^yazi\n    # Add other aliases as needed\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, looking at your configuration file, I notice you don't have an aliases section yet. Here's how to add aliases to your configuration:",

Added a zellij keybinding:\nI added an `Alt+e` keybinding in your zellij config that will launch the strider file manager (which is zellij's file manager plugin). Since `$mod` in zellij is usually `Ctrl+g` by default, `Alt+e` is a good alternative for quickly opening a file manager.\n\nWith this setup:\n- In your terminal, you can now use the `yz` command as a shortcut for `yazi`\n- In zellij, you can press `Alt+e` to open the integrated file manager in a floating pane\n\nIf you want to use a different key combination in zellij instead of `Alt+e`, you can change it by modifying the zellij configuration file. For example, if you want to use `Ctrl+g` followed by `f` and then `e`, you would need to create a similar binding in one of the mode sections.",

Let me check if I modified any existing keybindings in your zellij config, and then provide you with a comprehensive list of your available keybindings.\n\nFirst, let me verify what I did to your zellij config:\n\nLooking at my previous modification, I did add a new keybinding (`Alt+e`) to the `shared_among \"normal\" \"locked\"` section, which didn't override any existing keybinding as far as I can see. However, let me provide you with a complete overview of all available keybindings in your zellij configuration.\n\nHere's a comprehensive breakdown of all your current zellij keybindings:\n\n## Your Current Zellij Keybindings\n\n### Basic Navigation:\n- `Ctrl+g` - Switch to locked mode (main command key)\n- `Alt+left/right/up/down` - Move focus between tabs or panes\n- `Alt+h/j/k/l` - Move focus between panes/tabs\n- `tab` - Switch focus (in some modes)\n\n### Pane Operations (use with `Ctrl+g` then the letter):\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `n` or `Alt+n` - New pane\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `d` - New pane down\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `r` - New pane right\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `x` - Close focus\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `c` - Rename pane\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `f` - Toggle focus fullscreen\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `w` or `Alt+f` - Toggle floating panes\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `e` - Toggle pane embed or floating\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `z` - Toggle pane frames\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `h/j/k/l` - Move focus to specific pane\n- `Ctrl+g` + `p` + `tab` - Switch focus\n\n### Tab Operations (use with `Ctrl+g` then the letter):\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `n` - New tab\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `x` - Close tab\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `r` - Rename tab\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `s` - Toggle active sync tab\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `b` - Break pane to new tab\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `[` - Break pane left\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `]` - Break pane right\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `tab` - Toggle tab\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9` - Go to specific tab\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `h/j/k/l` - Go to previous/next tab\n- `Ctrl+g` + `t` + `left/right` - Go to previous/next tab\n\n### Resize Operations (use with `Ctrl+g` then the letter):\n- `Ctrl+g` + `n` + `+` or `=` - Increase pane size\n- `Ctrl+g` + `n` + `-` - Decrease pane size\n- `Ctrl+g` + `n` + `h/j/k/l` - Increase pane in direction\n- `Ctrl+g` + `n` + `H/J/K/L` - Decrease pane in direction\n\n### Move Operations (use with `Ctrl+g` then the letter):\n- `Ctrl+g` + `h` + `h/j/k/l` - Move pane in direction\n- `Ctrl+g` + `h` + `tab` - Move pane\n- `Ctrl+g` + `h` + `n` - Move pane\n- `Ctrl+g` + `h` + `p` - Move pane backwards\n\n### Scroll Operations (use with `Ctrl+g` then the letter):\n- `Ctrl+g` + `s` + `s` - Search\n- `Ctrl+g` + `s` + `e` - Edit scrollback\n- `PageUp/PageDown` or `Ctrl+b/Ctrl+f` - Page scroll\n- `d/u` - Half page scroll\n- `h/j/k/l` or `left/down/up/right` - Scroll in direction\n\n### Search Operations (in search mode):\n- `n` - Search down\n- `p` - Search up\n- `c` - Toggle case sensitivity\n- `o` - Toggle whole word\n- `w` - Toggle wrap\n\n### My Addition:\n- `Alt+e` - Launch or focus the strider file manager plugin in floating mode (this was added to the \"shared_among\" section, so it works in both normal and locked modes)\n\n### Mode Switching:\n- `Ctrl+g` - Switch to locked mode\n- `m` - Switch to move mode\n- `r` - Switch to resize mode\n- `t` - Switch to tab mode\n- `o` - Switch to session mode\n- `s` - Switch to scroll mode\n- `Ctrl+q` - Quit zellij\n- `Ctrl+c` - Cancel/return to locked mode\n- `Esc` - Return to locked mode\n- `Enter` - Return to locked mode\n- `p` - Switch to pane mode (from some modes)\n\n### Quick Mode Switching:\n- `Ctrl+g` + `g` - Switch to normal mode from locked mode\n\n### Session Management:\n- `Ctrl+g` + `o` - Switch to session mode\n- In session mode: `c` - configuration, `d` - detach, `p` - plugin manager, `w` - session manager\n\nTo answer your question: I didn't modify any existing keybindings, I only added the new `Alt+e` binding which didn't conflict with any existing bindings in the shared_among \"normal\" \"locked\" section.",

I've now set up everything you requested:\n\n## Summary of Changes Made:\n\n1. **Created a comprehensive Spanish markdown guide** (`/home/lr/.config/zellij/keybindings_guide.md`) that includes:\n   - Complete Zellij keybindings\n   - Neovim keybindings (LazyVim)\n   - ToggleTerm keybindings\n   - Other relevant tools and plugins\n\n2. **Added a new keybinding in Zellij**:\n   - `Alt+k` - Opens a new pane running Neovim to view the keybindings guide\n   - This allows you to access the complete guide with a single key combination\n\nYour Zellij configuration now has the `Alt+k` keybinding (in both normal and locked modes) that will open a new pane with Neovim showing the keybindings guide. This makes it easy to reference all your shortcuts directly from within Zellij.\n\nThe guide covers:\n- All Zellij keybindings (pane management, tabs, resizing, etc.)\n- Neovim shortcuts from your LazyVim setup\n- ToggleTerm terminal shortcuts\n- Harpoon, Mini Files, Copilot and other plugins\n\nThis guide will be accessible anytime you press `Alt+k` in your Zellij session, allowing you to quickly reference any of your keybindings.\n\nNote: Your existing `Alt+e` keybinding for the file manager is still active and unchanged.",
