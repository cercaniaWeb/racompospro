      "content": "It looks like you encountered a Node.js out-of-memory error (FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed). This happens when Node.js runs out of heap memory during garbage collection.\n\nHere are a few ways to address this:\n\n1. **Increase Node.js memory limit**:\n   ```bash\n   # Increase to 4GB (default is usually 512MB-1.4GB)\n   export NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=4096\"\n   ```\n\n2. **For specific commands**:\n   ```bash\n   # Run a specific command with more memory\n   node --max-old-space-size=4096 your-script.js\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for memory leaks** in your application code - large objects being held in memory, infinite loops, or recursive calls that don't terminate.\n\n4. **Process data in chunks** if you're handling large datasets, rather than loading everything at once.\n\nWould you like me to help you identify what might be causing the high memory usage in your specific application?",
