You can test it by:\n- Copying text with `\"+y` (yank to system clipboard)\n- Pasting from system clipboard with `\"+p`\n- Using regular visual mode selections which should now sync with the system clipboard\n\nThe only remaining issues in your Neovim health check are:\n1. A Node.js provider issue (which appears to be a display issue in the health check)\n2. Missing Perl and Ruby providers (which are optional and not needed for basic functionality)\n\nYour clipboard provider issue has been fully resolved!",

The resize mode section has:\n\n```\nbindsym $mod+r mode \"resize\"\nmode \"resize\" {\n    bindsym k resize shrink height 10 px or 10 ppt\n}\n```\n\nThis means when you're in resize mode (after pressing `$mod+r`), the key `k` will shrink height. This should not conflict with `$mod+k`.\n\nNow let me also check the other arrow key commands to make sure they don't have similar issues. Let me verify the h, j, k, l commands in the resize mode and outside:\n\nOutside resize mode:\n- `$mod+h` focus left\n- `$mod+l` focus right  \n- `$mod+j` focus down\n- `$mod+k` focus up\n\nIn resize mode:\n- `h` resize shrink width\n- `l` resize grow width\n- `j` resize grow height\n- `k` resize shrink height\n\nThese should be fine since they're in different contexts. Let me run the validation one more time to make sure:",

The configuration is syntactically valid and all paths and keybindings are correctly defined.",
