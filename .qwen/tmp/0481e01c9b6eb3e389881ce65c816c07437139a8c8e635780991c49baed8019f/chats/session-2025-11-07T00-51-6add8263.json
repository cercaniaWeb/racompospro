Here's what I've implemented:\n\n1. **React Development Tools Script** (`/home/lr/.config/i3/scripts/react-dev-tools.sh`):\n   - A comprehensive menu with 4 main categories:\n     - Debugging React Apps (6 options)\n     - Testing React Apps (6 options) \n     - Building React Apps (6 options)\n     - General Development (8 options)\n   - Includes history tracking functionality\n   - Each option provides specific MCP commands for React development\n\n2. **MCP Tools Script** (`/home/lr/.config/i3/scripts/mcp-tools.sh`):\n   - Direct access to individual MCP servers (Chrome DevTools, Playwright, Terminal, etc.)\n   - Quick access to specific tools for React development\n\n3. **Updated Polybar Configuration** (`/home/lr/.config/polybar/config.ini`):\n   - Added \"⚛️\" React Development Tools module\n   - Added \"⚙️\" MCP Tools module\n   - Both modules launch their respective Rofi menus when clicked\n\n4. **Updated AI Modal** (`/home/lr/.config/i3/scripts/ai-modal.sh`):\n   - Added \"MCP Tools\" option to the main menu\n   - Maintains all previous functionality\n\n5. **Support Scripts**:\n   - `/home/lr/.config/i3/scripts/launch-react-dev.sh` - Direct launcher for React tools\n   - `/home/lr/.config/i3/scripts/execute-mcp.sh` - For future MCP command execution\n\nTo use these new features:\n1. **From Polybar**: Click the ⚛️ icon to access React development tools, or the ⚙️ icon for MCP tools\n2. **From AI Modal**: Run your existing AI modal and select \"Desarrollo React\" or \"MCP Tools\"\n3. **From Terminal**: Run `/home/lr/.config/i3/scripts/react-dev-tools.sh` directly\n\nThe prompts are fully categorized and utilize your MCP configuration as intended, providing specific commands for debugging, testing, and building React applications. Each option shows the exact MCP command that should be used with your Qwen CLI setup.\n\nTo make the changes take effect, you may need to restart your Polybar: `polybar main &` or restart your i3 session.\n\nAll scripts are executable and properly integrated with your existing setup.",

Tu Polybar ya debería estar configurada de esa manera con los cambios que hicimos. La configuración actual mantiene:\n\n- Elementos en azul (color #0084FF): Icono de aplicación activa, CPU, RAM, HDD, Fecha/Hora, y el módulo de IA\n- Elementos en amarillo (color #FFFF00): Bluetooth y Powermenu\n\nEsto se debe a que en la configuración que implementamos:\n- Los módulos del centro usan `${colors.blue}` o directamente `%{F#0084FF}`\n- Los módulos de bluetooth y powermenu mantienen el color amarillo original en la configuración\n\nLa Polybar ya debería estar mostrando esta combinación de colores como solicitaste.",
